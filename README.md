# Acknowledgements
To convert .pdf files to text, used the "pdfplumber" Python library, which I discovered through this [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-extract-text-from-pdf-245482a96de7).
To convert text files to .mp3 files, I used [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API.
